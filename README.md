A [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buzzfeed-to-failing-pile/ofhgonkfnghihlemjaflfjdcohlhcohf?hl=en-US&gl=US) that replaces the text "BuzzFeed" with "Failing Pile of Garbage"; based on [@danksinker](https://twitter.com/dansinker)'s [Tiny Hands](https://github.com/sinker/tinyhands). 

[The extension is available from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buzzfeed-to-failing-pile/ofhgonkfnghihlemjaflfjdcohlhcohf?hl=en-US&gl=US).

Also available on BuzzFeed: a sorting quiz that will tell you what [famous pile of garbage](https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahjewell/what-famous-pile-of-garbage-are-you) you happen to be and [bumper stickers](https://shop.buzzfeed.com/collections/everything/products/copy-of-work-at-bumper-sticker?variant=35971001290) if you, too, get your news from "a failing pile of garbage." 

Proceeds from Failing Pile merch were donated to [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://cpj.org/).

If you'd like to use this as a foundation for your own Chrome extension, you'll need [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish).
